With the Port forwarding feature you can bind the container ports to a specific network interface. This allows other machines on the same network to access the containers. As a user you need to configure the firewall to allow inbound traffic to the containers. Example Scenario \u00b6 In this example scenario we are going to publish an nxing container on HTTP/80 on an external network interface. The example scenario contains the following steps Run nginx container on Port 80 Enable Port forwarding in COntainer Desktop Configure the Windows Firewall Run nginx container on port 80 \u00b6 First, we run an nginx container with the -p argument to publish it on port 80: docker run -p 80:80 -d nginx Note: The first part of the value for the -p argument is the port on the host.

Note: all published ports are exposed on the chosen network interface. Make sure you\u2019re aware of what containers you\u2019re exposing to your external network interface.
